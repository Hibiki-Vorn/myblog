# Prioritize Paying Yourself

***You must pay yourself first.***

* The rich pay for their future first (FFA).

* The poor always pay other people’s bills.

* You must pay yourself 10% first, and then you can become rich.

* Follow the trends instead of fighting destiny.

* The rich work to create passive income, not just to earn money.

***Be free first, then get more.***

***What you have believed is not a mistake.***

***If you wouldn’t be willing to set that money on fire, don’t invest it.***

***How you do anything is how you do everything.***

***All meaning is self-imposed.***

***Be free first, then pursue wealth. Purchase luxury goods only after you have enough passive income.***

***Do not evade your responsibilities.***

***A problem exists only when it stands above you. Once you stand above it, it becomes trivial.***
