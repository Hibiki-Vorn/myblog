# Families

<span style="font-weight:800;font-size:x-large">A harmonious family leads to success in everything.</span>

## Couple

* Both partners should contribute the same amount from their salaries to the public account, even if their incomes are different.
* Each person’s private account and the public account should have six jars.

## Children

* The habit of financial management is far more important than the amount involved, even if it is just 10 cents.
