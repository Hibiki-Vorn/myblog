# Feminism

Feminism is a social theory or movement for analyzing and removing gender inequality and discrimination, as well as patriarchal oppression.

## Liberal Feminism

They believe we should achieve equality through reform of laws and regulations, including the right to education, political participation, and employment opportunities. They focus on eliminating discrimination in policies and legislation and strive for equal rights. This is the most mainstream and moderate form.

## Radical Feminism

They believe the root cause of oppression suffered by women is patriarchy, and that we need to change the structure of society. They focus on the role of gender, sexual violence, the structure of the family, and patriarchy in culture. They call for a revolution in the structure of society, not just a reform of policies.

## Socialist Feminism

Gender oppression is intrinsically linked to capitalism and class exploitation. They focus on women's unpaid domestic labor, gender division of labor within the labor market, and the impact of capitalist economic structures on women. They believe in integrating class analysis to advance socio-economic systemic transformation.

## Postmorden Feminism

They believe the identity of women is affected by cultural, racial, class, sexual orientation, and other multiple factors. They argue there is no common experience of women because every woman's experience is different. They believe "gender" is not naturally fixed but socially constructed. Gender identity is shaped by language, social norms, and power relations, not biologically determined. This perspective examines how discourse, symbols, and language shape gender relations. For instance, cultural stereotypes such as “women must be gentle, men must be strong” are the result of power being transmitted through language and culture.

## Existentialism

One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. Sartre said existence precedes essence, and Beauvoir said the same applies to women. But society, culture, and history impose certain gender roles on women. She believes women are not destined to be passive and submissive; they should achieve freedom through action, choice, and self-creation.

## Feminist Separatism

They believe women should separate from men in order to establish a zone only for women.
