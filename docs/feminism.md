Feminism is a social theory or movement for analysising and removing rights unbalance and discriminantion of gender and patriarchal oppression.

## Liberal Feminism

They think we should reach equality through reform of laws and regulations including the right to education, political participation, employment opportunities. They focus on to cancel the discriminantion of policies and legislation and to striving for equal rights. This is the most mainstream and moderation one.

## Radical Feminism

They think the root cause of oppression suffered by women is patriarchy and we need change the structure of the sociaty. They focus on role of gender, sexual violence, structure of family and patriarchy in culture. They need a revolution of the structure of the sociaty not only a reform of policies.

## Socialist Feminism

Gender oppression is intrinsically linked to capitalism and class exploitation. They focus on women's unpaid domestic labour, gender division of labour within the labour market, and the impact of capitalist economic structures on women. They think integrating class analysis to advance socio-economic systemic transformation.

## Postmorden Feminism

They think the identity of women is affected by cultural, racial, class, sexual orientaion and other mutiple factors. They think there is no common experience of women because every woman's experience is different. They think "gender" is not natural fixed but social constructed. Gender identity is shaped by language, social norms, and power relations, not biologically determined. It examines how discourse, symbols, and language shape gender relations. For instance, cultural stereotypes such as “women must be gentle, men must be strong” are the result of power being transmitted through language and culture.

## Existentialism

One is not born, but rather becomes a woman.Sartre has said existence precedes essence. And Beauvoir said women is existence precedes essence too. But society, culture, and history impose certain gender roles on women. She think women are not destined to be passive and submissive; they should achieve freedom through action, choice, and self-creation.

## Feminist Separatism

They think we should separate from men in zoon to establish a zoon only for women.
