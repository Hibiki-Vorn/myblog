# Stoicism

The key to stoicism is distinguishing between controllable and uncontrollable factors.
Your choices, judgment, and actions are controllable factors, and weather, others's attitudes, and providence are uncontrollable factors. We should pay attention to the controllable factors, not the uncontrollable factors.

Emotion is natural reaction but we ought not to be controlled by emotion and we should inspect it by reason.
