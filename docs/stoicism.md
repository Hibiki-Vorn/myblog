# Stoicism

The key of stoicism is distinguishing between controllable and uncontrollable factors.
Your choices, judgement and actions are controllable factors and weather, other's attitude, previdence are uncontrollable factors. We should pay attention on the controllable factors not uncontrollable factors.

Emotion is natural reaction but we ought not to be controlled by emotion and we should inspect it by reason.
