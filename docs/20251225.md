# Unluckily
A few days ago, my NAS broke. Do you want to know why it happened? It's because when I was cleaning my NAS, I tried to enter `rm -rf ./*` but I forgot the `.`, and then, as you can guess, disaster struck.

Now I have completely fixed it and use rsync to back it up. I hope nothing untoward happens again, but if it does, please, God bless me.
