# Unluckily
A few days ago, my nas was broken. Do you want to know why it happend? It is because when I clean my nas, I try to enter `rm -rf ./*` but I forgot the `.` and then what you knew happend. 


And now I have fixed it completely and use rsync to backup it. I hope it should not anything untoward happening but if it would happen, please god bless me.
