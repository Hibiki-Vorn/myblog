<h1 id="feminisim">Feminisim</h1>
<p>Feminism is a social theory or movement for analysising and removing rights unbalance and discriminantion of gender and patriarchal oppression.</p>
<h2 id="liberal-feminism">Liberal Feminism</h2>
<p>They think we should reach equality through reform of laws and regulations including the right to education, political participation, employment opportunities. They focus on to cancel the discriminantion of policies and legislation and to striving for equal rights. This is the most mainstream and moderation one.</p>
<h2 id="radical-feminism">Radical Feminism</h2>
<p>They think the root cause of oppression suffered by women is patriarchy and we need change the structure of the sociaty. They focus on role of gender, sexual violence, structure of family and patriarchy in culture. They need a revolution of the structure of the sociaty not only a reform of policies.</p>
<h2 id="socialist-feminism">Socialist Feminism</h2>
<p>Gender oppression is intrinsically linked to capitalism and class exploitation. They focus on women's unpaid domestic labour, gender division of labour within the labour market, and the impact of capitalist economic structures on women. They think integrating class analysis to advance socio-economic systemic transformation.</p>
<h2 id="postmorden-feminism">Postmorden Feminism</h2>
<p>They think the identity of women is affected by cultural, racial, class, sexual orientaion and other mutiple factors. They think there is no common experience of women because every woman's experience is different. They think "gender" is not natural fixed but social constructed. Gender identity is shaped by language, social norms, and power relations, not biologically determined. It examines how discourse, symbols, and language shape gender relations. For instance, cultural stereotypes such as “women must be gentle, men must be strong” are the result of power being transmitted through language and culture.</p>
<h2 id="existentialism">Existentialism</h2>
<p>One is not born, but rather becomes a woman.Sartre has said existence precedes essence. And Beauvoir said women is existence precedes essence too. But society, culture, and history impose certain gender roles on women. She think women are not destined to be passive and submissive; they should achieve freedom through action, choice, and self-creation.</p>
<h2 id="feminist-separatism">Feminist Separatism</h2>
<p>They think we should separate from men in zoon to establish a zoon only for women.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
<h1 id="pgp">PGP</h1>
<p>PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) is a tech for protect the safety of data.
In internent, our email, files in drives, messages and so on are often saved in servers as plain data so it is important to protect your privacy and data safety. PGP is a tool for encryption, decryption and digital signature for data in internet. It is used for protection safety of email and file data.</p>
<p>Everyone has a key pair contains a public key and a private key. Public key for encryption verify the signature and privte key for decryption and signing. It is high security and needless to exchange the keys before it but complex to use.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
<h1 id="stoicism">Stoicism</h1>
<p>The key of stoicism is distinguishing between controllable and uncontrollable factors.
Your choices, judgement and actions are controllable factors and weather, other's attitude, previdence are uncontrollable factors. We should pay attention on the controllable factors not uncontrollable factors.</p>
<p>Emotion is natural reaction but we ought not to be controlled by emotion and we should inspect it by reason.</p>

      <title>Are there many illegal things in dark webs?</title>
      <link>https://blog.hieronymus.uk/dw-intro</link>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1 id="are-there-many-illegal-things-in-dark-webs">Are there many illegal things in dark webs?</h1>
<p><img alt="Tor" src="./img/tor.png" /></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>What's this in your mind?</p>
<p>A black market forllicit transactions, a breeding ground for criminal activities, or a hub for extremist content and terrorism?</p>
<p>This article takes you to explore the real dark web.</p>
<h2 id="tor">Tor</h2>
<h3 id="what-it-is">What it is</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initially, NRL(Naval Research Laboratory) has been proposed the conception of "onion routing". It is to encrypt the data by keys and decrypt when data pass throught the node by its own key.</li>
<li>In 1998, NRL publish the first prototype of tor for America goverment, military and research organisations for security communications.</li>
<li>In 2002, Roger Dingleding, Nick Mathewson and other researchers was developing tor project and then published the first version of tor in 2004.</li>
<li>In 2006, non-profit organisation tor project was established.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>Every domain of tor dark website must has 56 characters with suffix of <code>.onion</code>. It is differnent with the normal internet, domain was not registered by DNS. When you want to establish a new tor dark website, tor will generate a new key pair by Ed25519 algorithm. Add a prefix and version information to the public key, then hash the data with SHA-256 and encode it with Base32, resulting in a 56-character <code>.onion</code> address so each <code>.onion</code> address looked like an list of random characters not readable words but we can generate the <code>.onion</code> address which begins at readable words by "Vanity Onion Generator" and its principle is looping to generate address until it meets the requirement so if you do not have enough computing power, it will be so slowly. Every <code>.onion</code> domian are saved in the directory authority servers to offer the client which want to vist tor dark website. These directory authority servers were controlled by torproject and they are public so if these were blocked by censership, there are people cannot use tor and to counter this, Tor's anti-censership create a things which called "bridge" to allow those people to access tor connection. </p>
<p><img alt="Web tunnel bridge" src="./img/webtunnel.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;color:grey">Web tunnel bridge</div>

<p>Our ordinary people can access Tor dark web using <strong>Tor Browser</strong>, it is very convenient to use right out of the box.</p>
<p><img alt="Tor Browser" src="./img/torbrowser.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;color:grey">Tor Browser</div>

<p>To access surface web in tor connection will through 3 tor nodes. The first is guard node, the second is middle node and the third is exit node. To access Tor dark web will through 6 tor nodes not directly. Each you and that website has 3 nodes. This circuit has no exit node, instead by rendezvous point. Every nodes encrypt the circuit by the TLS 1.3 certification by an algorathm of Ed25519 and exchange TLS key when the circuit begining to start. Firstly, you send a request which encrypted by the first node's public key for exchanging key to the fisrt node. Secondly, send the request which encrypted by the second node's public key for exchanging key to the second node and this has encrypt by first node's key. Thirdly, get the key of third key in same way. Encrypting the data sequentially from the last key to the first key and then the node decrypt by their key when through it until to the last node and it know which site you want to visit and it will visit it for you and return the result by the same route.</p>
<p><img alt="Tor Nodes" src="./img/tor-nodes.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;color:grey">Tor Nodes</div>

<h2 id="the-truth">The truth</h2>
<p>At the point, You're clever enough to have realised that this action must be too slow so it is not suitable to watch live and download large files. And it is not suitable for most ordinary people too so the dark web constitutes merely 7% of the entire internet. There are few crimes in darkweb except fraud and the dark web is not a lawless zone.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>This is my first article of dark webs. Thank you for your reading. Acutally, dark webs are not for the exclusive use of criminals. The value of technology lies in the user's intent.</p>

<p>We keep alive and have been making choices all along and we should bear the consequences of choices and not shift it to the God, destiny or others. Free is not effortlessly with responsibility and burden. Free is not a gift but an inscapable obligation.</p>

<h1 id="asymmetric-encryption">Asymmetric encryption</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-asymmetric-encryption">What is Asymmetric encryption?</h2>
<p>Imagine a senary that you want to mail a confidential document to your friend and avoid the postman steal it so you must lock it but how your friend unlock it. Do you want to mail a key to him after he received locked document? But than how do you keep the key safe? Somebody proposed an awesome way. He said after your friend received it, he can use his own key lock it again and mail it back to you and after you received it, you unlock your lock by your key and mail to him again. Finally he use his key to unlock his lock and then he can read it.</p>
<p>But in the cyber world. The lock and key are a same thing. So we need asymmetric encryption. There is a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. Use public key to encrypt and use private key to decrypt.</p>

<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generation</li>
<li>Pick 2 very big prime number randomly as $p$ and $q$. </li>

<h1 id="hlai">HLAI</h1>
<p>To help you extend the notes on <strong>HLAI (High-Level Analysis of Impact)</strong>, let's build on the existing structure and provide more examples and insights related to literary devices, their effects, and how to approach this task using a three-step strategy.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-three-step-approach-to-tackling-language-use-for-impact-questions"><strong>The Three-Step Approach to Tackling Language Use for Impact Questions</strong></h3>
<h4 id="step-1-analyse-various-literary-devices"><strong>Step 1: Analyse various literary devices</strong></h4>
<p>Literary devices are techniques used by writers to create certain effects in their writing. To identify these devices, it’s important to first <strong>highlight</strong> the device and determine whether it is a metaphor, simile, personification, imagery, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Literary Devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Directly compares two things without using "like" or "as."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simile:</strong> Compares two things using "like" or "as."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personification:</strong> Giving human characteristics to non-human objects or abstract concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hyperbole:</strong> Exaggeration for emphasis or effect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>"The storm roared in anger."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlighting:</strong> "storm roared"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Metaphor (the storm is compared to something that can roar, like a wild animal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The use of "roared" personifies the storm, giving it an aggressive, loud, and wild characteristic. This sets the tone for a dangerous or violent storm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>"His room was a pigsty."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlighting:</strong> "room was a pigsty"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Metaphor (the room is compared to a pigsty, a place associated with filth and disorder).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This metaphor emphasizes the disorderliness and messiness of the room, stressing the level of neglect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-2-explain-why-the-writer-chose-to-use-a-literary-device"><strong>Step 2: Explain why the writer chose to use a literary device</strong></h4>
<p>Once you've identified a literary device, it's important to ask why the writer chose it. What is the effect? What qualities does the writer want to highlight or draw attention to?</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>"The lion’s teeth were knives."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Metaphor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> The writer compares the lion's teeth to knives because both knives and teeth are sharp and dangerous. The writer is emphasizing how razor-sharp the lion’s teeth are, which makes them seem more threatening and fierce.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>"Her heart was a locked door."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Metaphor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> This metaphor suggests that the character’s emotions or feelings are closed off, inaccessible, or difficult to approach, emphasizing her emotional isolation or reluctance to open up to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<p>"The road stretched on like a ribbon."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Simile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> The simile compares the road to a ribbon, emphasizing its smoothness, uniformity, and possibly its never-ending nature. It evokes a sense of continuity or a journey that seems to stretch endlessly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-3-identify-what-the-writer-is-emphasising-with-the-literary-device"><strong>Step 3: Identify what the writer is emphasising with the literary device</strong></h4>
<p>The final step involves identifying what the writer is trying to <strong>emphasize</strong>. What does this comparison or description tell us about the object, person, or situation?</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>"The storm roared in anger."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> The metaphor emphasizes the storm's intensity and power, making it feel alive, fierce, and destructive. It suggests that the storm is more than just a weather event—it’s almost a living entity that can express anger.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>"His room was a pigsty."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> This metaphor highlights the level of mess and chaos in the room. It emphasizes the disorder and untidiness, possibly suggesting the character’s laziness or lack of care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<p>"Her heart was a locked door."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> The metaphor focuses on the emotional distance or coldness of the character. It suggests that the character is closed off, unable or unwilling to share her emotions with others, creating a sense of emotional isolation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="more-examples-for-practice"><strong>More Examples for Practice</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><em>"The wind howled through the trees like a wolf on the hunt."</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlighting:</strong> "wind howled like a wolf"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Simile (comparing the wind to a wolf)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The writer is using a simile to compare the wind’s howl to the eerie and dangerous sound of a wolf’s cry. This adds a feeling of fear, danger, or wildness to the wind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is emphasised:</strong> The comparison emphasizes the intensity and wildness of the wind, making it seem untamed and threatening.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><em>"Time is a thief."</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlighting:</strong> "Time is a thief"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Metaphor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The metaphor compares time to a thief, suggesting that time steals moments, experiences, or opportunities from us, often without us noticing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is emphasised:</strong> The metaphor emphasizes the fleeting and often unnoticed nature of time, making it seem like something that takes away precious moments in an almost stealthy way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="pro-tips-for-extending-your-analysis"><strong>Pro Tips for Extending Your Analysis</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Emotional Impact:</strong> When analyzing a literary device, consider the emotional impact on the reader. For example, metaphors like "her heart was a locked door" evoke feelings of isolation, while similes like "the wind howled like a wolf" create a sense of fear or unease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think About the Context:</strong> The literary device might have different meanings depending on the context of the story or poem. For instance, a metaphor comparing something to fire could emphasize passion, destruction, or purification, depending on the surrounding imagery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of Imagery:</strong> Writers often use literary devices to create vivid imagery. Consider how metaphors and similes paint pictures in the reader's mind and evoke sensory experiences. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example of Imagery:</strong></p>
<p><em>"The scent of the roses filled the air, sweet and intoxicating."</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Device:</strong> Imagery (sight, smell)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is emphasised:</strong> The sensory richness of the roses. The use of “sweet and intoxicating” emphasizes the power of the scent, possibly implying that the roses’ fragrance is overwhelming or emotionally stirring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>By practicing these steps—<strong>analyzing</strong>, <strong>explaining</strong>, and <strong>emphasizing</strong>—you’ll be able to break down any piece of writing with clarity and depth. Use the above examples and strategies to enhance your understanding and analysis of literary devices, and you’ll find it easier to connect with what the writer is trying to convey.</p>
