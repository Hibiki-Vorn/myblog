To help you extend the notes on **HLAI (High-Level Analysis of Impact)**, let's build on the existing structure and provide more examples and insights related to literary devices, their effects, and how to approach this task using a three-step strategy.

### **The Three-Step Approach to Tackling Language Use for Impact Questions**

  

#### **Step 1: Analyse various literary devices**

  

Literary devices are techniques used by writers to create certain effects in their writing. To identify these devices, it’s important to first **highlight** the device and determine whether it is a metaphor, simile, personification, imagery, etc.

  

**Examples of Literary Devices:**

- **Metaphor:** Directly compares two things without using "like" or "as."

- **Simile:** Compares two things using "like" or "as."

- **Personification:** Giving human characteristics to non-human objects or abstract concepts.

- **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration for emphasis or effect.

  

**Example 1:**

"The storm roared in anger."

  

- **Highlighting:** "storm roared"

- **Device:** Metaphor (the storm is compared to something that can roar, like a wild animal).

- **Explanation:** The use of "roared" personifies the storm, giving it an aggressive, loud, and wild characteristic. This sets the tone for a dangerous or violent storm.

  

**Example 2:**

"His room was a pigsty."

  

- **Highlighting:** "room was a pigsty"

- **Device:** Metaphor (the room is compared to a pigsty, a place associated with filth and disorder).

- **Explanation:** This metaphor emphasizes the disorderliness and messiness of the room, stressing the level of neglect.

  

#### **Step 2: Explain why the writer chose to use a literary device**

  

Once you've identified a literary device, it's important to ask why the writer chose it. What is the effect? What qualities does the writer want to highlight or draw attention to?

  

**Example 1:**

"The lion’s teeth were knives."

  

- **Device:** Metaphor

- **Reason:** The writer compares the lion's teeth to knives because both knives and teeth are sharp and dangerous. The writer is emphasizing how razor-sharp the lion’s teeth are, which makes them seem more threatening and fierce.

  

**Example 2:**

"Her heart was a locked door."

  

- **Device:** Metaphor

- **Reason:** This metaphor suggests that the character’s emotions or feelings are closed off, inaccessible, or difficult to approach, emphasizing her emotional isolation or reluctance to open up to others.

  

**Example 3:**

"The road stretched on like a ribbon."

  

- **Device:** Simile

- **Reason:** The simile compares the road to a ribbon, emphasizing its smoothness, uniformity, and possibly its never-ending nature. It evokes a sense of continuity or a journey that seems to stretch endlessly.

  

#### **Step 3: Identify what the writer is emphasising with the literary device**

  

The final step involves identifying what the writer is trying to **emphasize**. What does this comparison or description tell us about the object, person, or situation?

  

**Example 1:**

"The storm roared in anger."

  

- **Emphasis:** The metaphor emphasizes the storm's intensity and power, making it feel alive, fierce, and destructive. It suggests that the storm is more than just a weather event—it’s almost a living entity that can express anger.

  

**Example 2:**

"His room was a pigsty."

  

- **Emphasis:** This metaphor highlights the level of mess and chaos in the room. It emphasizes the disorder and untidiness, possibly suggesting the character’s laziness or lack of care.

  

**Example 3:**

"Her heart was a locked door."

  

- **Emphasis:** The metaphor focuses on the emotional distance or coldness of the character. It suggests that the character is closed off, unable or unwilling to share her emotions with others, creating a sense of emotional isolation.

### **More Examples for Practice**

  

**Example 1:**

*"The wind howled through the trees like a wolf on the hunt."*

  

- **Highlighting:** "wind howled like a wolf"

- **Device:** Simile (comparing the wind to a wolf)

- **Explanation:** The writer is using a simile to compare the wind’s howl to the eerie and dangerous sound of a wolf’s cry. This adds a feeling of fear, danger, or wildness to the wind.

- **What is emphasised:** The comparison emphasizes the intensity and wildness of the wind, making it seem untamed and threatening.

**Example 2:**

*"Time is a thief."*

  

- **Highlighting:** "Time is a thief"

- **Device:** Metaphor

- **Explanation:** The metaphor compares time to a thief, suggesting that time steals moments, experiences, or opportunities from us, often without us noticing.

- **What is emphasised:** The metaphor emphasizes the fleeting and often unnoticed nature of time, making it seem like something that takes away precious moments in an almost stealthy way.

### **Pro Tips for Extending Your Analysis**

  

1. **Identify the Emotional Impact:** When analyzing a literary device, consider the emotional impact on the reader. For example, metaphors like "her heart was a locked door" evoke feelings of isolation, while similes like "the wind howled like a wolf" create a sense of fear or unease.

  

2. **Think About the Context:** The literary device might have different meanings depending on the context of the story or poem. For instance, a metaphor comparing something to fire could emphasize passion, destruction, or purification, depending on the surrounding imagery.

  

3. **Use of Imagery:** Writers often use literary devices to create vivid imagery. Consider how metaphors and similes paint pictures in the reader's mind and evoke sensory experiences. 

  

**Example of Imagery:**

*"The scent of the roses filled the air, sweet and intoxicating."*

  

- **Device:** Imagery (sight, smell)

- **What is emphasised:** The sensory richness of the roses. The use of “sweet and intoxicating” emphasizes the power of the scent, possibly implying that the roses’ fragrance is overwhelming or emotionally stirring.
