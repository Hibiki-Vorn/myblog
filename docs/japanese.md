# War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression

Why do they lost humanity? This is the most important question in this war. If we do not know the anwser of this, the war will never really stop.

## Education

Children have instilled some idea of national interests come first or the individual is for the nation. Textbooks refered to loyalty to the Emperor, obedience to the state, and sacrifice of personal interests as collective honor and admire the actions of war, Heroes died in battle and died for their country. So the most teenagers in Japan at that time want to grow up quickly for the honor of our motherland and become great Japanese citizens. These idea was only in textbook and commonly found in children's books.

## Media

The media was completely controlled by the government for changing the public sentiment. Any message in newspaper, radio or others must depict the action of invasation as East Asian co-prosperity, national defense or other positive things. All media reports must undergo strict review. Media used inflammatory text to emphasize that the war is a national honor and a civic duty.

## Ideology

The Japanese government emphasize the ideology called Kokutai. It means:
- Every Japanese was a part of the country firstly and then must serve the national interest.
- The Emperor holds a sacred and inviolable status, to whom unconditional loyalty is owed.
- Sacrifice on the front lines is touted as the highest honor, embodying "loyalty to the nation".

## Stability maintenance

Silencing and suppressing critics or those who do not support the government has resulted in virtually no public opposition to the war within the country. There is a law in Japan called Peace Preservation Law in 1925 to the end of the second world war. It Prohibited from organizing groups aimed at altering Japan's Kokutai or promoting socialist or communist ideologies. It labels numerous political ideas and statements as endangering national stability and authorizes police to arrest or punish those involved. During this period, tens of thousands have been detained for issues related to their beliefs and associations.

## Kamikaze

Kamikaze, this word means “divine wind,” derived from the historical legend of a “wind sent from heaven” that saved Japan from Mongol invasion. This is a team in the end of the second world war. The strength of the Japanese military declined, so they must use this team to carry out suicide attacks. Their Suicide was interpreted as bushido. The government redefine the death to them to overcoming the fear of death. Many team member expressed the afraid of death in letters for their family so the survival instinct has not truly been eliminated.
