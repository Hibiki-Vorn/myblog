# GrapheneOS

## Prologue

Do you want to avoid tracking by big tech companies? <br/>
Do you want to escape surveillance? <br/>
Do you want to protect your secrets and privacy?

If so, GrapheneOS may be suitable for you.

## Description

GrapheneOS is an operating system based on AOSP (Android Open Source Project). It places a strong emphasis on privacy and security, which has led to a common bias that it is only for fugitives.

It can only run on Google Pixel phones, and the project has explicitly stated that it will never support other devices.

## Features

* You can enable strong authentication with fingerprint unlocking and set a password of up to 128 characters to resist brute-force attacks. If you are concerned about coercion, you can also configure a duress password to protect your data under extreme circumstances.

* You can use Seedvault to securely back up app data.

* You can avoid data leaks by using Storage Scopes and Contact Scopes, which allow apps to access only the specific files or contacts you approve, while the app believes it has full access.

* On most Android ROMs with GApps, Google Play Services have permissions that cannot be fully restricted through system settings. In GrapheneOS, Sandboxed Google Play allows you to run Google services with the same restrictions as normal apps.

* You can disable apps’ access to sensors on your phone to prevent unnecessary commercial tracking and abuse of privileged access.

* You can change the behavior of USB connections, including disabling data transfer or even charging.

* The system includes a firewall that allows you to block network access for individual apps.

* The system uses `hardened_malloc` to mitigate memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## The End

GrapheneOS is not about hiding from the world, but about taking control of your own device.

It is one of the most secure mobile operating systems available today. However, it may not be easy for everyone to use, as it does not rely on fully privileged Google Play Services.

Some people assume that only fugitives care deeply about privacy. I disagree. Privacy is not a luxury—it is a fundamental human right.

This system is suitable for ordinary users who value privacy, as well as developers and technology enthusiasts. If you are highly dependent on Google Play Services, it may not be suitable for you, as it is difficult to achieve both maximum convenience and strong privacy at the same time.
