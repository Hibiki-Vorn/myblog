# Mind-Body Problem

## Description

Descartes argued that humans have two fundamentally different kinds of **substance**: the **physical world** (the body) and the **mental world** (the mind). Descartes’ dualism is a form of **substance dualism**, which holds that mind and body are distinct yet somehow interact. This interaction raises a central philosophical issue: **How can two fundamentally different kinds of substance causally influence each other?** Descartes suggested the **pineal gland** as the site of interaction, but this has been widely criticized as inadequate and biologically implausible.

## Occasionalism

**Representative Figures:** *Nicolas Malebranche*
Occasionalism rejects direct causal interaction between mind and body. Instead, what seems to be interaction is actually the result of God’s intervention on every occasion. For example, when a person wills to move their arm, God produces the physical movement at that moment. This avoids the direct interaction problem but introduces a theological hypothesis about God’s constant causal action.

## Pre-established Harmony

**Representative Figures:** *Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz*
Pre-established harmony also denies direct causal interaction. In this view, mind and body are two parallel systems that never interact but unfold in perfect harmony with each other because God arranged them to correspond from the start. So mental events and physical events are coordinated like two clocks that keep the same time without touching.

## Property Dualism

Here the mind and physical world are not two different substances but are **two different kinds of properties** of the same underlying thing (e.g., the brain). In property dualism, mental properties are non-physical properties that emerge from or accompany physical processes, but they are not separate entities. This avoids some problems of substance dualism while recognizing that mental phenomena have qualities that are not easily reducible to physical descriptions.

## Physicalism

Physicalism (often also called materialism) holds that **everything that exists is physical** or ultimately explicable in physical terms. Under this view, mental states are either identical with physical states of the brain or can be fully explained by physical processes. According to physicalism, talk of a separate mental world is an illusion or shorthand for complex brain activity. 

## Optional: Alternative or related views

* **Interactionism:** A branch of substance dualism that explicitly claims causal interaction between mind and body (what Descartes originally tried to defend).

* **Epiphenomenalism:** The view that physical events cause mental events, but mental events do not cause physical events.

* **Monism / Idealism:** Some philosophies deny the fundamental distinction, claiming either everything is mental (idealism) or that the mental and physical are aspects of one neutral substance. 

## Summary of Views

| View| What it holds| How it treats interaction |
|-|-|-|
| Dualism (Cartesian) | Mind and body are distinct substances| They interact (but hard to explain) |
| Occasionalism | Mind and body don’t interact directly| God coordinates events|
| Pre-established Harmony | Mind and body run in parallel| Synchronized from the beginning |
| Property Dualism| Mind and body are different properties of the same substance | No separation in substance, mental still distinct |
| Physicalism | Only physical reality exists | Mental is physical or reducible to physical |
