# Self-introducing

Hello, thank you for looking at my blog. My name is Hieronymus. I know something about frontend development and Linux. I also know something about trading. Furthermore, I will use this blog to record my diary, notes on programming, or some interesting things in my daily life. You can contact me by touching [this](https://links.hieronymus.uk/).
