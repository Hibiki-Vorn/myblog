# Existentialism

## Existence precedes essence.

People are not objects. Objects, for example, a cup, are created for drinking, and their purpose is unchangeable—even a broken cup is still for drinking. But people are not born for a purpose; people have complete liberty. If a mother gives birth to a baby for a purpose, it means the parents do not treat him as a human being.

## Human existence is a state of “thrownness” into the world.

We have no power to decide our parents, environment, society, or country. When we realize this, it has already happened, and then we have to face our liberty, responsibility, and choices.

## Man is condemned to be free.

We stay alive and have been making choices all along, and we should bear the consequences of our choices and not shift them to God, destiny, or others. Freedom is not effortless; it comes with responsibility and burden. Freedom is not a gift but an inescapable obligation.
