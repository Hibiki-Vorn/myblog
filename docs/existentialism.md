# Existentialism

## Existence precedes essence.

People was not goods. Goods, for example, a cup was created for drinking and the purpose was unremoveable and a broken cup are still for drinking. But people was not birthed for a purpose, people have compelete liberty, if a mother birth a baby for a purpose, it means the parents are not keep he as a human.

## Human existence is a state of “thrownness” into the world.

We have no power to deside our parents, environemt, sociaty, country. When we realised, it has happend and then we have to face our liberty, responsibility and choices.

## Man is condemned to be free.

We keep alive and have been making choices all along and we should bear the consequences of choices and not shift it to the God, destiny or others. Free is not effortlessly with responsibility and burden. Free is not a gift but an inscapable obligation.
