PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a tech to protect the safety of data.
On the internet, our emails, files in drives, messages, and so on are often saved in servers as plain data, so it is important to protect your privacy and data safety. PGP is a tool for encryption, decryption, and digital signature for data on the internet. It is used for the protection and safety of email and file data.

Everyone has a key pair that contains a public key and a private key. Public key for encryption, verify the signature, and private key for decryption and signing. It is high security and needless to exchange the keys before it but complex to use.
